<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Installing nanoweb</H1>

Installation of the nanoweb web server should be fairly easy, as the
commandline tool <b>install-sh</b> will do the work for most of you.
<br>
For Windows you may wish to use the <b>install.bat</b> (which should be
customized to your needs before running it). Please have a look into the
<A HREF="../README.windows">README about Windows installation</a> also.


<H4>Compiling PHP</H4>

Nanoweb requires the interpreter of the PHP scripting language to be
present on your system. You can get the source code from
<A HREF="http://www.php.net/">www.php.net</A>, but it is often much better
to use a precompiled package (for Windows especially!) if there is one in
your distributions CD set. However the precompiled ones often miss the
<b>pcntl</b> extensions which gives mcuh more speed on UNIX systems, so
you're encouraged to compile PHP yourself and to adopt it to your needs:

<br>
<br>

To compile it for »CGI« or »CLI« support (the latter one is often better
suited for standalone scripts like nanoweb)
all you need to do is to execute the <b>configure</b> program from the
unpacked source tarball this way:

<br>
<br>

<KBD>./configure --with-<b>cgi</b> --enable-<b>cli</b> --enable-sockets --enable-pcntl</KBD>

<br>
<br>

You may want to add other very common configure options like
<tt>--with-zlib</tt> to use mod_gzip, and <tt>--with-mysql</tt> to have
MySQL-support compiled in (but see ./configure --help for a complete list).

<br>
<br>

<KBD>make</KBD> will start the build process, the binary should afterwards
be installed using <KBD>make install</KBD>.

<br>
<br>

If compilation with the above instructions fails, then you should have a look
into the README from the PHP tarball, which starts with a »quick install
guide«.


<H4>Install nanoweb</H4>
Run <KBD>./install-sh</KBD> and follow instructions ...
<br>
Starting from nanoweb 2.0 the install-sh will appear with a nice text or
graphical user interface if you installed one of the "dialog" utilites
(namely cdialog, Xdialog, whiptail or the one of the linux kernel tarball),
so the installation or update should be much easier.

<br>
<br>
Type 'nanoctl start' to start the server and connect to
<A HREF="http://localhost/">http://localhost/</A> to see if it works.

<br>

<H4>install-sh commandline options</H4>
<ul>
<li> <kbd>install-sh <b>-f</b></kbd> does a quick <b>--force</b>d installation into the default
directories. </li>
<li> <kbd>install-sh <b>-v</b></kbd> is more <b>--verbose</b> </li>
</ul>

<br>

<H4>Installing under user-account</H4>
If you're not root you'll need to take special care for installtion
and configuration (you can not run it on TCP port 80 as ordinary user).
The best way to install it is then doing it by hand. You could just copy
everything into one one directory under your home directory, this however
requires to configure the directory names correctly inside the configuration
files.
