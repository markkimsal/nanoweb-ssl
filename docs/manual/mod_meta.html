The <a href="ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc2068.txt">HTTP/1.1
specification</a> recommends, that parties involved in transfer of hypertext
files should evaluate the <b>&lt;META&nbsp;HTTP-EQUIV&gt;</b> header tags of
HTML pages as they would usual http transfer headers.
<br>
<PRE CLASS="samp">&lt;HTML&gt;
 &lt;HEAD&gt;
   &lt;META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html"&gt;
   &lt;META HTTP-EQUIV="Refresh" CONTENT="5; URL=page2.html"&gt;
   &lt;META HTTP-EQUIV="X-Note" CONTENT="Nanoweb rulez"&gt;
...</PRE>
<br>
<br>

mod_meta reads html files and makes these fields available in the actual
http responses, as well as to other nanoweb modules which may want to see
these additional http headers. All recent browsers understand these
HTML-internal header fields, but proxys and webservers should be aware of
them, too. However one can assume that proxys are regularily not, so this
module is a good idea if you want to assure that the actual content is
handled correctly by all involved http software.
<br>
<br>

Besides this, mod_meta reads <b>companion .meta files</b> that may exist and
also makes the http headers found therein available in the http response.
One could do this with <a href="mod_asis.html">mod_asis</a> also, but for binary
files this method is much easier to realize. The companion files require to
have exactly the same name as the files to which the meta data should be
added plus ".meta" at the end. If your file would have the name
"example.html" the companion http headers file needed to have the name
"example.html.meta". These files may only contain http header lines, no
empty lines and especially no comments:
<PRE CLASS="samp">Content-Type: text/html
Content-Features: tables, javascript, css, color, graphic
X-Note: Nanoweb rulez!
</PRE>
<br>
<br>

How this module reads the META tags from the HTML files can be defined with
the <a href="core.html#metafetch">MetaFetch directive</a>. The value
'<b>fast</b>' is the default and makes mod_meta use very fast string
artithmetics to grep the content of the tags out of the html head. This
however only works if these headers are in the form seen above (case
doesn't matter of course).
<br>
If you want more reliability than you could use '<b>regex</b>' instead,
which also makes standard META tags (author, description, ...) available to
other modules.
A value of '<b>no</b>' makes mod_meta not evaluate the html files, so only the
.meta files are appended to the http response headers (the headers don't get
available for use by other nanoweb extension modules currently).
<br>
You can effectively disable mod_meta with MetaFetch=<b>0</b>, this is useful if you
want it to activate for some directories and files only.
