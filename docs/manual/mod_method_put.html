<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">PUT request method</H2>

The PUT request method as defined in 
<a href="ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc2068.txt">RFC2068</a>
(HTTP/1.1) allows clients to upload files to the server much like with FTP.
This is normally not desired, so it is encapsulated into an extension module
for Nanoweb.
<br>
<br>
The PUT file upload feature should only be enabled for some dedicated
directories using the <a href="core.html#writeaccess">WriteAccess directive</a>
in one of the .nwaccess files. Additionally to this, files can only be overwritten if
they were made "world-writable" using <tt>chmod o+rw example.file</tt>. You
could also make a whole directory writeable or <tt>chown</tt> the writeable
files to the user or group id Nanoweb runs with.
<br>
<br>

<b>Important</b>: For your security you really should make only single files writeable
or disable executing of CGI scripts in a dedicated directory, or else anybody may
execute arbitrary script code on your server and thus easily spy sensitive data.
See the <a href="core.html#forcehandler">ForceHandler</a> directive on how
to prevent uploaded files from being parsed as cgi scripts.
<br>
Also very important is to keep the setting "IgnoreDotFiles=1", or else
anybody would be able to remove your .nwaccess file.
