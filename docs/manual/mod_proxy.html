<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">mod_proxy</H1>

With the nanoweb internal proxy server you can save download time as it
caches all requests gone through it. This is especially useful if you have a
local network with one internet gateway server which also works as firewall
to the local network (in this special case you are really encouraged to use
mod_proxy).
<br>
Beside its caching facility it can help you to filter unwanted content
(whole sites, images and popups as well).

<br>
<br>

In order to make use of mod_proxy, you have to make it loaded by nanoweb
by uncommenting the according <A HREF="core.html#loadmodule">LoadModule
directive</A> in the <tt>modules.conf</tt>; and you need of course to setup
proxy usage in all browsers you want to use on the computers of your local
network (use port 80 as for accessing nanoweb itself).

<br>
<br>

You may want to tweak the behaviour of mod_proxy with following directives:

<BR>
<H3><A NAME="proxyaccesslog">ProxyAccessLog directive</A></H3>
<B>Syntax:</B> ProxyAccessLog = /var/log/nanoweb/proxy.log <BR>
<B>Context:</B> Server Config <BR>
<P>
The proxy module generates an additonal seperate log file, as you probably
don't want the main server log to be intermixed with request informations
for files that are not located in your servers docroot.
</P>


<BR>
<H3><A NAME="proxyallowip">ProxyAllowIP directive</A></H3>
<B>Syntax:</B> ProxyAllowIP = 168.192. <BR>
<B>Context:</B> Server Config <BR>
<P>
Use this directive to allow hosts or all hosts from a network (with an
abbreviated IP address range) to access the www via the nanoweb internal
proxy server. Hosts not listed here cannot make use of the nanoweb proxy.
</P>


<BR>
<H3><A NAME="proxycachedir">ProxyCacheDir directive</A></H3>
<B>Syntax:</B> ProxyCacheDir = /var/cache/nanoweb <BR>
<B>Context:</B> Server Config <BR>
<P>
The proxy module of course needs a dedicated directory where it can save all
the files that were requested in the past, so that they do not need to be
fetched a second time from the real server if they get requested another
time.
</P>


<BR>
<H3><A NAME="proxydenysite">ProxyDenySite directive</A></H3>
<B>Syntax:</B> ProxyDenySite = /etc/nanoweb/badsites <BR>
<B>Context:</B> Server Config <BR>
<P>
If you want some servers not to be accessible through your proxy you just
need to list them in a text file (one server name per line) which you
specify here; so access to such servers will be forbidden.
</P>
