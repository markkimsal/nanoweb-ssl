The pfilters module allows you to pass the contents of delivered pages
(static files as well as CGI output) through any of the internal filters or
through any external filter program available on your system.
<br>
<br>
All the filters get available when the appropriate module is loaded (core
filters within mod_pfilters, "gzip" filter is part of mod_gzip, and some
extension filters are located in mod_html_pfilters). However except mod_gzip
these filters are not active until you put a <A HREF="core.html#filter">Filter
directive</A> referencing them into the configuration files:<br>
<PRE CLASS="samp"> FilterEnable = 1
 Filter =        */*   null  -- you don't want to use this one!
 Filter =        */*   unchunk
 Filter =  text/html   pipe  /usr/bin/tidy -q -latin1
 Filter = text/xhtml   pipe  /usr/bin/tidy -xml -q
 Filter =  text/html   wap
 Filter =    image/*   wbmp 100x60
#Filter =        */*   gzip  -- this is added automagically by mod_gzip
</PRE>

Note: every filter is assigned to a mime-type, and it will only be
executed if the current content matches this. This way you could bind
»tidy« to html files and for example »watermark« to image files.

<br>
<br>

Besides mime-types you can also use file extensions to make a filter rule.
Finally both can be combined:
<PRE CLASS="samp"> Filter = .html        null
 Filter = .exe         pipe /usr/local/f-prot/f-prot -ai -
 Filter = .txt|.pdf    null
 Filter = pdf|image/*  null</PRE>

<br>

These are the currently available filters:

  <TD BGCOLOR="#FFEEEE" WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"> core </TD>
  <TD> Content from CGIs is often chunked, that means it is is splitted
       into many parts and thus cannot be passed to filters (like 'pipe')
       which require to work on the whole file. So you always should enable
       the unchunk filter which tries to resemble all chunks up to a given
       size (128K without argument). For example <tt><nobr>Filter = */* unchunk
       300</nobr></tt> would try to recombine chunks up to 300 kbytes.

  <TD BGCOLOR="#EEEEFF" WIDTH="15%" VALIGN="TOP"> <b>pipe</b> </TD>
  <TD BGCOLOR="#FFEEEE" WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"> core </TD>
  <TD> The pipe filter is the most powerful of all the filters, as it is
       used to pass the current content through an external filter program,
       that is given as argument to this filter (you need to specify the
       full path name here, as it is prior checked for existence).
       <br>
       Filter programs are very common utilities in a UNIX-like environment,
       but you probably want to use html-aware or xml-capable filters only.
       <br><small>
       BTW, the »pipe« filter is the one, the pfilters
       infrastructure was implemented for.</small></TD>

  <TD BGCOLOR="#EEEEFF" WIDTH="15%" VALIGN="TOP"> <b>shrink</b> </TD>
  <TD BGCOLOR="#FFEEEE" WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"> html_filters </TD>
  <TD> This filter tries to remove all newlines from your html page, so
       it'll get to just one line. Beside the smaller size (also helps gzip)
       your page gets unreadable without appropriate tools and this makes
       it a small weapon against code sniffing.<br>
       <b>Warning</b>: this conversion does not harm your CSS areas (per
       specification of the w3c), but ElsewhatScript gets unusable if it
       contains comments; additonally this filter refuses to work if the

  <TD> Converts all tags and their attributes (where missing quotation marks
       are added also) to lowercase which additonally helps compressing the
       file. This filter is rather slow.

  <TD> tries to convert your html to wml code; but this rule is of course
       only applied if the client actually requests wml.<br>
       The HTML should be valid, else the WML won't be too, so it is highly
       recommended to use a more sophistcated external conversion utility
       instead of this very slow internal one.
       <pre class="samp"># best way to use the »wap« filter:

  <TD> There exists a demo filter package for images; and the convert filter
       enables you to change the image type from png to jpeg and vice versa
       by specifying the target format after the filter name. Some other
       file formats may be supported (for input at last), but note that
       .gifs are rather rarely allowed and thus cannot be used with

  <TD BGCOLOR="#FFEEEE" WIDTH="10%" VALIGN="TOP"> misc_filters </TD>
  <TD> This filter corresponds to the apache »AddHandler« directive and

       given as argument to this filter.<br>
       <PRE CLASS="samp">Filter = .myhtm|.txt /cgi-bin/needs-frame.php</PRE>
       In this example files with the extension .myhtm or .txt would invoke
       the given php script with PATH_INFO set with the filename of the
       originally requested .myhtm or .txt file. So this script (handler)
       must take care to produce some output out of the file (build some
       html table around loaded plain text file, or such things). </TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<br>
<br>

Note that you can <b>disable all filters at once</b> with the
<A HREF="core.html#filterenable">FilterEnable directive</A> on a per-directory
basis.

<br>
<br>

The name »pfilters« comes from the fact that it wraps a filter around the
nanoweb internal »parser« objects which represent the requested files.

<br>
<br>

The module mod_gzip now uses the pfilters infrastructe as well, so there is
no need to take care if the Filter rules are mentioned before mod_gzip, as
this is ensured internally (most filters don't work on already compressed
content).
