What ??! 

Nanoweb is an HTTP server written in PHP, designed to be small, secure, 
and extensible.

The main features are :

- HTTP/1.1 compliance
- Powerful and easy configuration
- Modular architecture
- FastCGI, CGI and Server side includes support
- Name and port based virtual hosts
- Access control lists
- htpasswd, MySQL, PostgreSQL and LDAP authentication support
- Themes for server generated content
- Apache compatible log format, MySQL logging
- Directory browsing
- inetd support and SSL via external helpers
- Denial of Service protection
- Proxy Server extension
- Filters and gzip support
- RBL support (mail-abuse.org)
- Extension Protocols (request methods) support
- ... and a lot more


Why ? 

Why did I do it ? I found the idea of using a language mostly aimed at web 
scripting to write a web server was quite funny. That's all, really ...

Why should you use it ?

It's light, fast and robust.
Also being written in PHP makes it very easily extensible with custom modules,
and secure because - running inside the Zend scripting engine - it's immune
to a number of common security threats (format strings, buffer overflows, ...)


How ? 

Read INSTALL, and follow the simple installation steps.

Interesting readings after install is done :

- User Manual (http://localhost/manual or http://nanoweb.si.kz/manual)
- The 'docs' directory contains some brief infos about individual parts of the
  server, modules, and some howtos.
- The 'ChangeLog' file contains the list of all added features and this could
  be useful.
- Default configuration files are well commented and reading them should help
  you getting started too.

For any other concerns about nanoweb, please consult the general or support
forums at <http://forums.t0x.net/?c=2> or mail the author.
