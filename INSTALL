To install and run nanoweb properly, you need a php4 binary built with the 
following configuration options :

--enable-cli (build the command line interpreter, default with PHP>=4.3)
--enable-sockets (for sockets manipulations)
--enable-pcntl (process forking and signal handling)
--enable-mime-magic (optional)
--with-zlib (optional, used by mod_gzip)
--with-mysql (optional, used by mod_mysqllog, mod_auth_mysql)
--with-ldap (optional, used by mod_auth_ldap)

for PHP>=4.3, use 'make install-cli' after building

When you are done with PHP, run ./install-sh and follow instructions ...
